## Description
The Smart Plant Moisture Meter will be used for managing indoor plants and when they should be watered. Many plants tend to get over-watered as a result of the top of the soil being dry but the middle being still moist. Having to probe you plant each day is also very annoying and easy to forget. The Smart Plant Moisture Meter helps indoor gardeners keep track of their plant's moisture level and notify gardeners via a phone app when it is time to water.
